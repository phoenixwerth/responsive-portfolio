      <p>Phoenix Werth enjoys long walks on the beach, staring at the sun for long periods of time, and chasing butterflys. Phoenix was born on April 17th 1999 in a wonderful great city known as "brighton" it was truly awful. Phoenix's favorite food is sardines soaked in olive juice and vinegar. Phoenix Werth truly is a wild animal, that cannot be tamed. We all know that it takes some kind of animal to eat sardines... let alone sardins soaked in olive juice.</p>

      <p> Phoenix Werth once spent 5 days in the hospital from an injury caused by a hawk. A viscous hawk swooped down and poked phoenix in the eye. Mirraculously Phoenix regained his vision and is now on a life mission to find the hawk that did that to him.
